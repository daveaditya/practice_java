Another example is the Args class,
    developed in the TestArgs Eclipse project.
This program requires more than one command line argument.

    Click on Run -> Run (not Run Last Launched).

    Click on the Arguments tab,
        in the large subwindow of the Run window.
    This action brings up the Program arguments window,
        where you should type in your input values.

    For the Args program,
        eight input argument values are needed.
    For this run, we have chosen eight random sets of
            characters, some numeric, some alphabetic, as input values:
        namely, 101, Joe, Larry, 93214, 3.145, 66, ABCDEF, xxxxx.
    Notice that there is at least one space between every two arguments.
